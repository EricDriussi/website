On the cloud, not on the cloud, that's the question.

<!--more-->

Since the idea came to me wile reading [this](https://www.autentia.com/libro/devops-la-guia-completa/) book, I'll make use of some of its illustrations.

## The issue

There's usually two ways to solve an issue or satisfy a need when it comes to computers: Either you solve it yourself or you trust that someone else will.

Either you write the code yourself or you include a library as a dependency.
Either you install an app to convert that file format or you upload it and wait for some server to give it back to you.

Of course, the issue isn't delegating responsibilities to whoever is better suited to manage them. It's more about being conscious that that's exactly whats going on.

> _Just let someone else deal with it._

The issue comes when our computers turn into little more than clients to access one or the other 'cloud' hosted web service.

## As a User

As end users the dilemma is quite simple: Â¿**Comfort** or **Control**?

-   Do we **trust** whoever offers the service?
-   Can we **depend** on the service?
-   Is it something irrelevant we'll probably never do **again**?
-   Are we interested in actually **learning** something?
-   Is the **information** we are handling sensible?

At the end of the day the comfy option will always be third party services (especially if they are **free**).
It would be nice however, to remember that '_the cloud_' is nothing more than some strangers computer to which we have no access.

Maybe without the **marketing** it'll deserve more attention.

## As a Dev / DevOps

Of course, as a dev things get a bit more complex.
Generally speaking, cloud based solutions are **so much more** economically coherent, that is quite hard to find a use case for the alternative.

Let's first see what these are

### On-Premise

![premise](../../../images/on-premise.png)

As mentioned above, it's the most secure option and the one that offers by far the most control on the projects infrastructure.

### Cloud

![cloud](../../../images/cloud.png)

The advantages are self evident here, although they deserve a big asterisk...

#### Services

In the end, cloud services are nothing more than 'Software as Service' & the likes.

A bit like living on rent because it's cheaper than mortgage: Maybe after a couple of years and considering that all that money bought you a great deal of nothing, one would have a different opinion.

Or maybe not. It might actually make more sense to rent that to buy depending on the case.

### Hybrids

![hybrid](../../../images/hybrid.png)

As with all mid-way solutions, it's got the best and worse of both worlds.
We better make sure to maximize the former and minimize the latter, applying each model where it's needed.
