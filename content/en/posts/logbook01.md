Or why starting to code using Java is not half bad.

<!--more-->

There is a fairly specific expectation between students (and not only) regarding what it means to learn something; what makes for a '_good lesson_'.

Accustomed to a system more concerned with bureaucracy and cuotas than with the task of comprehending reality or acquiring critical thinking skills, we often confort ourselves with the **progressiveness** of lectures (cool name for data accumulation) and with the **predictability** of short, mid and long term objectives (partials and finals).

Understandable reaction if we don't know any better but unusual in a capable and prepared professional.

With any luck we'll learn, sooner than later, that the reality at work bares little to no resemblance with this comforting and paternalist simulation.
With a bit more luck we'll see **in time** that none of the aforementioned is truly learning or knowledge building.

Reality doesn't have manuals, physics have no syllabus and people don't come with instructions.

Although a vague guide about how to tackle a problem is always welcome, adequately pointing to the needed resources should surely be even more welcome.

> Just tell me where to go, I'll find the way.

No one teaches us '_plumbing basics_'; you come up with a solution when a pipeline goes and wait for the plumber (and with a bit of **interest**, you ask a couple of questions and learn a thing or two).
In medical school they don't teach you how to deal with unbearable patients; you do your best when the time comes and next time **will be better**.
Best way to learn a new technology is... to **use it**, throw yourself into the ocean without much second thought.

We see the learning process as a linear and defined thing, when in reality it's necessarily a chaotic, 'uncomfortable' and janky process.

If public education is a Windows PC and private education is a Mac, learning consists, without a doubt, in installing Gentoo on a router just to '**see what happens**'.

None of this should sound new for those that, like myself, have had their first contact with programming through Java:

What makes more sense: dedicating the first 6 lessons to theorize about what's each one of these terms, or making a leap of faith and starting to break stuff to see what gives?
Do we sit down until we comprehend fully what each of these elements mean or do we accept that we are printing something to the screen and we'll see how it goes from there?
