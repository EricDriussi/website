<!--DRY stands for "donâ€™t repeat yourself," and a corresponding WET principle stands for "write everything twice." The DRY principle is often attributed to Andrew Hunt and David Thomas, whose book, the Pragmatic Programmer, came out in 2000.-->

<!--For instance, coding a repeatable task as a function means that function can be inserted and re-used anywhere in the code, and does not have to be re-written for various calls.-->

<!--Redundancies in process-->

<!--To prevent redundancies in processes (actions required to achieve a result), followers of the DRY principle seek to ensure that there is only one way to complete a particular process. Automating the steps wherever possible also reduces redundancy, as well as the number of actions required to complete a task.-->

<!--Redundancies in logic-->

<!--To prevent redundancies in logic (code), followers of the DRY principle use abstraction to minimize repetition. Abstraction is the process of removing characteristics until only the most essential characteristics remain.-->
