When in doubt, raise your hands and scream in fear.

A couple of days ago I remembered the importance of '_shadowing_'. It's been a while since I had the chance to follow along another persons thought process and see it in action.

I've found that no matter how much you know about something, it's always the same when it comes to actually put that knowledge to work.
One always feels like he knows best, especially if grades are good. But deep down inside we all feel the pressure once push comes to shove.

You just freeze for a while, often before the most basic tasks (which of course just makes it **worse**). Brain freezes, sweat starts pouring down, you question your life choices and ponder how bad would it be to just leave it at that and go live on your own in the mountain.

Thing is, the knowledge is there and probably the experience as well (especially in highly practical fields, where you basically learn by doing). You just need a nudge, a link to a good article on the topic at hand, a finger pointing you to the right path.

That, or a mentor. Not necessarily in the philosophical sense, just literally a guy (or more) with some expertise willing to have you screwing up around him.

The process of '_shadowing_' consists simply of being with that mentor while he works and (hopefully) explains what he is doing.
**You** should be the one asking the questions, don't just sit there expecting an oral exam of sorts. This is your chance to share a mind with a more capable professional: Make the most out of it.

Try and surround yourself with people from whom you can learn a thing or two, not just professionally.

Calm down, deep breath, relax and focus. Be proactive and **don't fear failure**.
