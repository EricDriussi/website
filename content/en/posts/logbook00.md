Well I kind of forgot this blog should have been a sort of diary of my apprenticeship.

I'm starting to realize that being a developer is about **much** more than knowing this or that programming language.
Not that this isn't important, but it definately pales in comparison to the complexity of the various technologies and _Frameworks_ that we use regularly.

On a different note it seems that, working within a team, it's very useful to operate with a set of common tools, like the IDE for example.
Same logic applies to _Docker_, with which one can simulate the same development/testing environment.
Just like with a VM, just that Docker saves up a **lot** of resources since it does not simulate hardware and shares kernel with the host OS.

Basically, more than learning a language it seems more important to properly learn to manage a _Framework_, a system or a given environment, and use the language to operate within these parameters.
