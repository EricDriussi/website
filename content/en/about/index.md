One day I decided to spin up a web server to try and build a [Searx instance](https://searx.unixmagick.xyz/) and to have some fun tinkering with it. Well, it only makes sense to fuck around with a static site generator like Hugo!

Since it seems to be mainly used as a simple substitute for technologies like Wordpress I decided would make sense to build a blog and here we are.

> y u no host on github page?

Well for starters I already had an itch to screw around with server side technologies, so I would have rented a VPS either way.
And to be perfectly honest I kinda crap my pants every time Github goes down for 5 minutes. I literally can't get anything done and it kinda scares me. I really didn't want to rely on big services even more then I already do.

Oh and BTW, I'm no webdev so no, I actually have no idea what I'm doing.
