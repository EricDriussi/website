                Born and raised in Italy, more than 15 years living in Spain. A couple of years in Venezuela and a bit more than a year in England. As you might expect it's been quite rocky and, while it's been nice to learn a couple of languages and widen my horizons, this 'being your own home' -sounds better than note having one- has it's disadvantages.

                Physiotherapist for the last 6 years, my mind is always a bit of a mess and always looks foreward to learning new stuff.

                I would be happy in a world in which using FOSS was the norm and I firmly believe that problems get solved by simplification, not by adding unnecessary ocmplexity.
                The fewer and more precise tools you use, the better.
